# LangChain

- a framework that allows us to build applications using LLM.

- Link: https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/

- 3 main concepts in Langchain
    1. **Components**
        - **LLM Wrappers**: allow us to connect to a LLM like GPT-4, HuggingFace.
        - **Prompt Templates**: allow us to avoid hardcoding text which is the input to LLMs.
        - **Indexes for information retrieval**: allow us to extract relevant information for the LLMs.

    2. **Chains**: allow us to combine multiple components mentioned above to solve specific tasks and build entire applications.

    3. **Agents**: allow LLM to interact with its environment and external APIs.
